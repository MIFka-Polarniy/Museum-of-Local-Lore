      <div class="text-content">Our countryman Alexander Ivanovich Rytov defended his Motherland from
        fascist invaders on the IL-2 aircraft. This aircraft was called "flying tank". Alexander Ivanovich Rytov was born into a peasant family on October 22, 1920, in the village of Zhabino. Sasha was 4 years old when his mother died, and at the age of 11 he lost his father. He studied first at the Zhabino school, then at the Burmakino. He loved mathematics, was fond of photography, made aircraft models with his brother, and dreamed of becoming a pilot. He graduated from the military diving school. In his letters, Alexander wrote: "I feel better in the air than on the ground."
        The pilot's combat path began in March 1942. Alexander was respected for his endurance, self-control, and ability to remain calm in any situation. Alexander Ivanovich repeated Castello's feat. In 1945, Rytov A.I. was posthumously awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union.</div>
