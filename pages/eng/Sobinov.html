        How connected with the Lyutovsky region: Leonid Vitalievich's grandfather Vasily was a sert peasant. He earned money in the waste trades and bought himself off. He built a house 'sobinno', isolated', i.e. away from the village of Torgovtsevo. By the way, this is one of the versions of the origin of the singer's surname.

      <div class="text-content">
        Leonid Vitalievich was in the village of Torgovtsevo twice: the first time at the funeral of his grandfather Vasily, and the second time when he made out the inheritance. The house has not survived to this day.
